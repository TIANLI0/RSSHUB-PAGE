                    Laser cladding is a process to apply metal coatings using a laser as heat source. The laser melts the base material and an additive powder to create a protective coating. Unlike thermal spraying, welding, or plating, laser cladding provides a strong metallurgical bond with minimal dilution of the base material, precise thickness control, and a small heat effected zone. This technique provides a faster and more cost efficient repair for our customers. Expensive one-of-a-kind components don’t have to be remanufactured; they can be repaired within days instead of months!                </p>
