                    By cross linking process the polyethylene insulation of the cable is made thermally steady and additionally the melting point is extraordinarily increased. So LT XLPE Cable In India has better resistivity to warm deformation for its higher warm resilience property. Because of magnificent warm properties the current carrying limit of XLPE cable is higher than that of ordinary cable.                </p>
